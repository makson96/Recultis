# [](#header-1)Lets play on Linux!

Recultis is the software, which easily allows you to install your favorite cult games on Linux. 
It uses modern, open source engines to run the game, and download game content form digital distribution platforms (for example Steam).
It works on any 64 bit Linux distribution. It does not require any installation - just download it and double click on the launcher. It is that simple! You can watch whole process on the YouTube video below.
Warning: Recultis 2.x requires Linux distribution from 2016 or newer (for example Ubuntu 16,04 or 18.04). If you have older Linux distribution, please stick to Recultis 1.2.

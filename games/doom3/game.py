features enhanced graphic and audio to original game. Doom 3 is one of
the best FPS games of all time. Unfortunately, it was never released
on Linux, but game engine was release open source. With many
enhancements and new features, game is now available on Linux and it
is better than ever before. Recultis uses RBDOOM-3-BFG flavor of the
engine and requires game to be present in your Steam Library.
